## Introduction
Tree-enhanced Embedding Mode (TEM) is a new recommendation framework, which combines the strong representation ability of embeddingbased and interpretability of tree-based models. At its core is an easy-to-interpret decision-tree and attention network, making the recommendation process fully transparent and explainable.

## Codes
We are finding license suitable to release this software. Currently codes are under request and will be released later.

## Dataset
We provide two processed datasets: London-Attractions (LON-A) and New-York-City-Restaurant (NYC-R) datasets.
* `London_Attractions_Complete_Review.csv`
  * All positive instances.
  * Each line is a review, where the fields of user profiles and item attributes start with 'u' and 'i', respectively.

* `New_York_City_Restaurant_Complete_Review.csv`
  * All positive instances.
  * Each line is a review, where the fields of user profiles and item attributes start with 'u' and 'i', respectively.
